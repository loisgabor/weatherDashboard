# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Our requirement for this assignment was to create a weather dashboard where the user can type in any city in the united states, and using three separate Apis, the user will have access to the current weather, temp, humidity, uv-index and the forecast for the next 5 days. After each search, the cities searched are stored on the side using local storage and when clicked on, the weather dashboard will update with that cities weather and forecast.

## Usage

In order to properly use this site, the user will have to first type in a city in the U.S. and click search. He will then be presented with the current weather and 5 day forecast. Due to local storage, whenever he/she types a new city, he/she will still have access to the previously searched city.
